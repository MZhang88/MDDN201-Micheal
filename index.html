    <h1>Transport</h1>
    <p>Wellington people usually use the trains to get to their desired location. This is because trains are more easier to access and that people do not have to worry about parking. Trains receive signal through lines so that that no trains can cause a collision. Trains run on fixed rails meaning that the rails can change/switch it's direction. Train controls involve movements when passed from those responsible for each section of a rail network (e.g., a signalman or stationmaster) to the train crew.</p> </div>
